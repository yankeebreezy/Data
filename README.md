Different datasets for exploratory analysis

Note: In unemployment.csv which was collected from IMF, india data was not available. Thus it was collected from various sources available in the study. Mainly through CMIE and news articles. This is soley meant for the study and exploration purpose and doesn't indicate actual numbers.
